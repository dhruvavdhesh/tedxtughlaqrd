								<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-sort-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-sort-up"></i>What is TED?</div>
								<div class="togglec" align="justify">Started 30 years ago in the spirit of “Ideas Worth Spreading” TED has grown to host 2 annual global conferences where the World’s leading Thinkers and Doers give short format talks--less than 18 minutes or less--on a diversity of topics from how to live on mars, to human beat boxing, to the beauty of human skin in every color, to how great leaders inspire change. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Al Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Their talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Long Beach, California, along with the TED Active simulcast in Palm Springs; the annual TED Global conference is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</div>

								<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-sort-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-sort-up"></i>What is TEDxTughaqRd?</div>
								<div class="togglec" align="justify">Because Institutions in India foster ground-breaking research, extraordinary ideas, and remarkable people, TEDxTughlaqRd looks forward to showcasing this brilliance and enabling these great ideas to be put into action.

								<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-sort-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-sort-up"></i>Why under 18 minutes?</div>
								<div class="togglec" align="justify">This short talk model works, since it only demands the audience's attention for a short period of time, decreasing the chance of minds wandering or daydreaming about lunch. In fact, some of our greatest TED Talks have been as short as 5 minutes long!</div>

								<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-sort-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-sort-up"></i>What is the difference between an idea and productive idea worth talking about as a Speaker at TEDXTughlagRd?</div>
								<div class="togglec" align="justify">It can actually be one of two things:
                                <ul>
									<li>Innovation, showcasing a surprising innovative approach unheard of.</li>
									<li>Basic implementation that has the potential to make a better impact than the formerly used alternatives.</li>
								</ul>
								In other words, an idea isn’t just a story or a list of facts. A good productive idea is built over evidence, team efficiency and iterative approaches of lean product development.
