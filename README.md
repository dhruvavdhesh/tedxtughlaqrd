# TEDxTughlaqRd

<p align="justify">As the Head of Technology for TEDxTughlaqRd, my goal was to uphold the prestige of Delhi's biggest and India's second-biggest independently organized TED event of 2016. I was responsible for the event website, visual designs, videos, social media, and guest experience strategy and we are one of the rare TEDx events worldwide to be allowed to use a custom logo.</p>
